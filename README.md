# SnipFeet - footwear retail store with Nextjs, Snipcart and Datocms

Snipfeet is a footwear retail store designed with `react.js` and `TailwindCSS` with the `Next.js` framework built on top of react.js. Utilizing features offered by Next.js such as -- `SSR`, `router` amongst others. 

Other tools used are: `DatoCMS` and `SnipCart` - Which were very easy to integrate. Considering that DatoCMS was already designed as a `headless CMS` i.e it requires a frontend tech such as react to function, which makes it the best choice for an eccommerce store.

**SnipCart** was also very easy to integrate especially since it was built with developers in mind.
